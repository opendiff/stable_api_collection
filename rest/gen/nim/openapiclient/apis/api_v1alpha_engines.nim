Changes will be communicated here, as well as on our online REST API documentation, which can be found at: https://api.stability.ai/docs  Your DreamStudio API key will be required for authentication. You can learn more about API keys here: https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication  If you encounter any issues, please let us know in the #API discord channel: https://discord.gg/stablediffusion
